        ScanCode is a suite of utilities used to scan a codebase for license,
        copyright, packages dependencies and other interesting information that
        can be discovered in source and binary code files.
        
        A typical software project often reuses hundreds of third-party
        components. License and origin information is often scattered and not
        easy to find: ScanCode discovers this data for you.
        
        ScanCode provides reasonably accurate scan results and the line position
        where each result is found. The results can be formatted as JSON or
        HTML, and ScanCode provides a simple HTML app for quick visualization of
        scan results.
        
        We are continuously working on new features, such as analysis of
        dependencies or improving  performance for scanning of larger codebases.
        
        See the roadmap for upcoming features:
        https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Roadmap
        
        .. image:: samples/screenshot.png
        
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        For Windows, please go to the 
        `Comprehensive Installation <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation>`_ 
        section instead.
        
        Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed:
         * Download and install Python 2.7 32 bits for Windows 
           https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi
         * Download and install Python 2.7 for Mac 
           https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13-macosx10.6.pkg
        
        On Linux install Python 2.7 "devel" and a few extra packages:
         
         * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev bzip2 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``
           for Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04
        
         * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev libbz2-1.0 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``
           for Debian and Debian-based distros
         
         * ``sudo yum install python-devel zlib bzip2-libs xz-libs libxml2-devel libxslt-devel``
           for RPM distros
         
         * See the Comprehensive Installation for additional details and other
           Linux installations: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation
        
        Next, download and extract the latest ScanCode release from::
        
            https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/
        
        Open a terminal, extract the downloaded release archive, then `cd` to
        the extracted directory and run this command to display the command
        help. ScanCode will self-configure if needed::
        
            ./scancode --help
        
        Run a sample scan saved to the `samples.html` file::
        
            ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html
        
        Then open `samples.html` in your web browser to view the scan results. 
        
        See more command examples::
        
            ./scancode --examples
        
        
        Support
        =======
        
        If you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:
        https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues
        
        For other questions, discussions, and chats, we have:
        
        - a mailing list at https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/aboutcode-discuss
        
        - an official Gitter channel at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss
          Gitter also has an IRC bridge at https://irc.gitter.im/
        
        - an official #aboutcode IRC channel on freenode (server chat.freenode.net)
          for scancode and other related tools. Note that this receives
          notifactions from repos so it can be a tad noisy. You can use your
          favorite IRC client or use the web chat at
          https://webchat.freenode.net/
        
        
        About archives
        ==============
        
        All code must be extracted before running ScanCode since ScanCode will
        not extract files from tarballs, zip files, etc. However, the ScanCode
        Toolkit comes with a utility called extractcode that does recursive
        archive extraction. For example, this command will recursively extract
        the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract directory::
        
            ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2

        Run this command for a list of options (On Windows use `scancode`
        instead of `./scancode`)::
        
            ./scancode --help
        
        Run this command for a list of command line examples::
        
            ./scancode --examples
        
        To run a scan on sample data, first run this::
        
            ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html
        
        Then open samples.html in your web browser to see the results.

        2.0.0 (2017-06-23)
        ------------------
        
         This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug
         fixes.
         
         Some of the key highlights include:
        
         * License:
        
           * Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple
             techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of
             a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.
        
           * Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses
             detection rules have been added making the detection significantly
             better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new
             detection engine)
        
           * the matched license text can be optionally returned with the
             `--license-text` option
        
           * The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection
             engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and
             comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.
        
           * improved scoring of license matches
        
        
         * Package and dependencies:
        
          * new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,
            NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,
            declared dependencies are also reported.
        
          * several additional package formats will be reported in the future
            version.
        
          * note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be
            considered API at this stage
        
        
         * Scan outputs: 
        
          * New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.
        
          * new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still
            available with the the `json-pp` format).
            The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a
            documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.
        
          * Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the
            html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode
            Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.
        
        
         * Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are
           no longer returned and copyright s are more accurate
        
        
         * Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive
           types (such as Spring boot shell archives)
        
        
         * Performance:
        
          * Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance
            has been significantly improved.
        
          * Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new 
            `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a
            full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about
            11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)
        
          * Reduced memory usage with the use of caching
        
         * Other notes:
        
           * This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support
           * The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120
             seconds default
           * ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package
             index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage
             will follow in future versions
           * New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and
             paths during a scan
           * New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data
           * The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or
             absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted
             path. 
        
        
         Thank you to all contributors to this release and the 200+ stars
         and 60+ forks on GitHub!
